### :bar_chart: Project 3

Exploring GoodThought NGO database with detailed records of assignments, funding, impacts, and donor activities from 2010 to 2023. The dataset includes:

- `Assignments`:
Details about each project, including its name, duration (start and end dates), budget, geographical region, and the impact score.
- `Donations`:
Records of financial contributions, linked to specific donors and assignments, highlighting how financial support is allocated and utilized.
- `Donors`: Information on individuals and organizations that fund GoodThoughtâ€™s projects, including donor types.

The below ERD diagram shows a visual representation of the relationships between these data tables:

## :one: List the top five assignments based on total value of donations, categorized by donor type. The output should include four columns: 1) `assignment_name`, 2) `region`, 3) `rounded_total_donation_amount` rounded to two decimal places, and 4) `donor_type`, sorted by `rounded_total_donation_amount` in descending order. 

````sql
WITH sub AS (
          SELECT a.assignment_name, ROUND(SUM(d.amount),2) AS rounded_total_donation_amount, dd.donor_type
          FROM assignments AS a
          JOIN donations AS d
          ON a.assignment_id=d.assignment_id
          JOIN donors AS dd
          ON d.donor_id=dd.donor_id
          GROUP BY a.assignment_name, dd.donor_type
          ORDER BY rounded_total_donation_amount DESC
          LIMIT 5)
SELECT a.assignment_name, a.region, sub.rounded_total_donation_amount, sub.donor_type
FROM sub
LEFT JOIN assignments AS a
ON sub.assignment_name=a.assignment_name
ORDER BY rounded_total_donation_amount DESC

## :two: Identify the assignment with the highest impact score in each region, ensuring that each listed assignment has received at least one donation. The output should include four columns: 1) `assignment_name`, 2) `region`, 3) `impact_score`, and 4) `num_total_donations`, sorted by `region` in ascending order. Include only the highest-scoring assignment per region, avoiding duplicates within the same region.
